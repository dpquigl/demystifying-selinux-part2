# demystifying-selinux-part2
Fork of the original demystifying selinux talk repo to extend it into a half day workshop

This repo is now defunct. This is kept around for historic reasons of tracking the history and keeping the original talk that was given available to people. The new combined repository of all talks will be available at http://github.com/dpquigl/demystifying-selinux
